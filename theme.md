**Theme Features**

You have a variety of options when choosing a theme for the features your website will offer. We made the decision to maintain a minimalistic approach, integrating only a few essential features because of the project guidelines and information about the client (design and cms experience).


**Design decisions**

Because this website is about education center so we decided to create the theme with user friendly colors like blue and yellow. Besides there are also many customizable features that users can use to add more information about course or CTA banners.


**Colours**

All colour schemes can be edited in customisation on WordPress or edited further in CSS. Additional tags would need to be created/edited.

Current background-colour: #ffffff Gradient button-colours: #377EF9, #E8B11C

**Fonts**

Only one custom is included with this theme. This font is called Montserrat.
