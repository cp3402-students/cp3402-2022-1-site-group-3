**Deployment:**
- Download and install Docker Desktop which can create localhost on your laptop.
- Clone the repository to your desktop or download and unzip the folder if downloaded.
- Now, run docker compose up -d from your project directory.
- Then, you can login in to your localhost/wp-admin to edit for your pages.
- Utilize a code editor such as Visual Code Studio or other IDE and run it as shown below. 
- Create a control commit in the IDE the user is using and then push the completed work.
- Create a relevant pull request for the main branch.
- After changes are merged in the main branch, users can import the repository into their local environment and upload it to the staging site via a zip file.
- If the test is successful on the staging website, the user can upload the theme zip folder to the production site.

**Version Control:**
- We managed our version control via [Github](https://github.com/JCU-CP3402/cp3402-2021-a2-cp3402-2021-team12).
- Version control will compare the old and the new version of the code or file in order to keep track of the changes that has been made by every member of the repository.
- We pushed our commits to github via github desktop, we kept our repository up-to date by making changes to our files that we uploaded. 

**Web Hosting:**
- The Production Site Used : https://baizonnlearningcenter.epizy.com/wordpress/
- The Web Hosting Used : https://www.infinityfree.net/ <br>
Infinityfree : It offers free web hosting with impressive marketing of unlimited disk space, bandwidth, and domain hosting. This, in theory, means you can host as many files as you want on your account server, have as many users visit your site as you want, and have as many primary web addresses as you want.

**Project Management:**
- ~[Github](https://github.com/cp3402-students/cp3402-2022-1-env-group-3)
Github: Developers frequently utilize the Github platform to create, distribute, and manage software, code, applications, and more. In this project, we made extensive use of Github to host a repository for all of our code and materials and to keep meticulous track of the changes we made. The website for github is https://github.com, and the repository for this project is located at https://github.com/cp3402-students/cp3402-2022-1-site-group-3.

- ~[Discord](https://discord.gg/xb6X3vsn)
Discord: Considering that it is a tool for team collaboration and communication, Discord is comparable to Slack. You design servers to fit your needs, and you divide and organize your work by creating channels within of those servers. With Discord, you may communicate, publish photographs, pin messages, and store files. Discord was chosen for this project because it has a larger audience than Slack and many of the group members are already members of other Discord servers.
