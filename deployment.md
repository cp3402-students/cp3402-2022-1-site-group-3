**Deployment:**
- Download and install Docker Desktop which can create localhost on your laptop.
- Clone the repository to your desktop or download and unzip the folder if downloaded.
- Now, run docker compose up -d from your project directory.
- Then, you can login in to your localhost/wp-admin to edit for your pages.
- Utilize a code editor such as Visual Code Studio or other IDE and run it as shown below. 
- Create a control commit in the IDE the user is using and then push the completed work.
- Create a relevant pull request for the main branch.
- After changes are merged in the main branch, users can import the repository into their local environment and upload it to the staging site via a zip file.
- If the test is successful on the staging website, the user can upload the theme zip folder to the production site.

**Version Control:**
- We managed our version control via [Github](https://github.com/JCU-CP3402/cp3402-2021-a2-cp3402-2021-team12).
- Version control will compare the old and the new version of the code or file in order to keep track of the changes that has been made by every member of the repository.
- We pushed our commits to github via github desktop, we kept our repository up-to date by making changes to our files that we uploaded.
