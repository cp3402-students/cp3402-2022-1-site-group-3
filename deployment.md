### Deployment and Development Workflow

**Development Team : Group 3**
- Date: 15/September/2022
- Course: CP3402 SP52 2022
- Members: Hein Htet Ko, James Makarios, Tuan Dat Tran & Hoai Thanh Pham

**Theme Development:** <br><br>
***PhpStorm(https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)*** 
- Major frameworks support : Working with frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Drupal, WordPress, Zend Framework, Magento, Joomla!, CakePHP, and Yii is made easy using PhpStorm.

- All the PHP tools : The editor truly "gets" your code and comprehends its structure, supporting both modern and legacy applications with all of the PHP language's features. The best code completion, refactorings, on-the-fly error prevention, and other features are offered by it.

- Front-end technologies included : Using the available refactorings, debugging, and unit testing, make the most of cutting-edge front-end technologies like HTML 5, CSS, Sass, Less, Stylus, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Emmet, and JavaScript. Because of Live Edit, you can see the changes right away in the browser.

- Built-in developer tools : Thanks to the integration of version control systems, support for remote deployment, databases/SQL, command-line tools, Docker, Composer, REST Client, and many more technologies, you can complete many common activities directly from the IDE.



**Deployment:**
- Download and install Docker Desktop which can create localhost on your laptop.
- Clone the repository to your desktop or download and unzip the folder if downloaded.
- Now, run docker compose up -d from your project directory.
- Then, you can login in to your localhost/wp-admin to edit for your pages.
- Utilize a code editor such as Visual Code Studio or other IDE and run it as shown below. 
- Create a control commit in the IDE the user is using and then push the completed work.
- Create a relevant pull request for the main branch.
- After changes are merged in the main branch, users can import the repository into their local environment and upload it to the staging site via a zip file.
- If the test is successful on the staging website, the user can upload the theme zip folder to the production site.

**Version Control:**
- We managed our version control via [Github](https://github.com/JCU-CP3402/cp3402-2021-a2-cp3402-2021-team12).
- Version control will compare the old and the new version of the code or file in order to keep track of the changes that has been made by every member of the repository.
- We pushed our commits to github via github desktop, we kept our repository up-to date by making changes to our files that we uploaded. 

**Web Hosting:**
- The Production Site Used : https://baizonnlearningcenter.epizy.com/wordpress/
- The Web Hosting Used : https://www.infinityfree.net/ <br>
Infinityfree : It offers free web hosting with impressive marketing of unlimited disk space, bandwidth, and domain hosting. This, in theory, means you can host as many files as you want on your account server, have as many users visit your site as you want, and have as many primary web addresses as you want. Infinity Free offers three shared hosting (opens in new tab) plans only, one of which is completely free-of-charge. It is titled “Infinity Free'' and it should include unlimited disk space, unlimited bandwidth (although it is limited to 50,000 daily hits), and unlimited hosting domains. It also supports 400 MySQL databases, a single FTP account, but not a single email account, and all of the above is granted with “limited server power”. Despite these limitations, at least the plan includes a free subdomain, free SSL certificates (opens in new tab) for all your domains, and a Softaculous auto-installer with over 400 handy apps.

**Project Management:**
- ~[Github](https://github.com/cp3402-students/cp3402-2022-1-env-group-3) <br>
Github: Developers frequently utilize the Github platform to create, distribute, and manage software, code, applications, and more. In this project, we made extensive use of Github to host a repository for all of our code and materials and to keep meticulous track of the changes we made. The website for github is https://github.com, and the repository for this project is located at https://github.com/cp3402-students/cp3402-2022-1-site-group-3.

- ~[Discord](https://discord.gg/xb6X3vsn) <br>
Discord: Considering that it is a tool for team collaboration and communication, Discord is comparable to Slack. You design servers to fit your needs, and you divide and organize your work by creating channels within of those servers. With Discord, you may communicate, publish photographs, pin messages, and store files. Discord was chosen for this project because it has a larger audience than Slack and many of the group members are already members of other Discord servers.
